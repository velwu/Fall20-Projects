# Fantastic Chess Variants and Whether They're Solved 
A student final project for the Fall 2020 semester of Data Structure & Algorithm at iSchool, UIUC

(yes, the title is a reference to [this other fantastic thing](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Fantastic_Beasts_and_Where_to_Find_Them_(film)), in case you've noticed. I am a proud Rowling fanboy~)


## What is this project and why is it important??

As a cornerstone for myself to build a Python chess AI (probably as an extra-curricular personal project) sometime in the future, this project involves analyses of many existing games in the [Minichess family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minichess)

Instead of relying on any mainstream chess libraries out there, **all chess pieces movement mechanisms are written in Python in their originality by myself**. This is an important element to demonstrate my own data structuring capabilities.

## Types of analyses:
- 1. 3x3 Boards 
  - Chess variants on a 3×3 board are not clearly defined, so it is not written in stone what pieces are involved or where they each start. These are largely solved games, however, so provide a good place to conduct simpler and quicker analyses.
  - This part will also likely involve some variants I created out of thin air because magic (alright, it's done on my laptop, but you get it).
  
- 2. 5x5 Boards
  - The only variant that is solved in this family is the Gardner minichess (with White player having an obvious advantage). This project will attempt to prove it mathematically and demonstrate it programmatically, while also analyzing the following variants:
    - Jacobs–Meirovitz
    - Mallett
    
Because Gardner is a solved and is an unbalanced (potentially unfun) game, the inclusion of the other two is important in making this project valuable.
